# DRT-PNEC
We propose a new VIO initialization method by extending the [rotation-translation-decoupled framework](https://github.com/boxuLibrary/drt-vio-init.git) with the addition of uncertainty parameters and optimization modules. This code is the implementation of our proposed method, which runs on **Linux**.
